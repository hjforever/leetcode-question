//You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi,
//pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is 
//created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis 
//representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent 
//points. One such example is shown below: 
//
// Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day 
//and Y-axis representing the price.
//The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
//- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), 
//and (4,4).
//- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
//- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), 
//and (8,1).
//It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using 
//less than 3 lines.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
//Output: 1
//Explanation:
//As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a 
//single line.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= stockPrices.length <= 10‚Åµ 
// stockPrices[i].length == 2 
// 1 <= dayi, pricei <= 10‚Åπ 
// All dayi are distinct. 
//
